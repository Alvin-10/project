Description:

Parameter 0 of constructor in com.alvin.project.userservice.controller.AuthController required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- authServiceImpl: defined in file [C:\Project\User_Service\target\classes\com\alvin\project\userservice\service\AuthServiceImpl.class]
	- userServiceImpl: defined in file [C:\Project\User_Service\target\classes\com\alvin\project\userservice\service\UserServiceImpl.class]

This may be due to missing parameter name information

Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Ensure that your compiler is configured to use the '-parameters' flag.
You may need to update both your build tool settings as well as your IDE.
